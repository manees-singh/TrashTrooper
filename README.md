# Trash Troopers

**Trash Troopers** is an engaging video game developed using the `pygame` library in Python. Your mission is simple yet thrilling: collect all the trash on the screen while avoiding and battling trash monsters. Dive into a fast-paced environment where quick reflexes and strategic movement are key to survival.

## Gameplay Overview
- **Objective**: Collect all the trash scattered on the screen.
- **Challenge**: Trash will spawn in the middle area of the screen, but be on the lookout for aggressive trash monsters. They will try to deplete your health as they move toward you.

## Controls
- **Movement**:
  - **WASD**: Move up, left, right, and down.
  - **Arrow Keys**: Alternate option for movement.
- **Pause**:
  - **Esc**: Pause the game.
- **Attack**:
  - **Space Bar**: Hold to attack trash monsters when they are within range.

## Game Mechanics
- **Health Bar**: Your health bar will increase as you collect trash. However, contact with the trash monsters will reduce your health rapidly, so stay vigilant!
- **Trash Spawning**: A new piece of trash will appear on the screen every 10 seconds. Speed and precision are essential to keep up with the increasing number of trash pieces.
- **Monster Behavior**:
  - Trash monsters patrol the area and will chase you if you come too close.
  - You can de-aggravate the monsters by moving away from their range.
  - Be cautious when attacking – the monsters are already dangerously close when you’re within attack range.

## Tips for Success
- Start moving immediately after loading the game to avoid an early encounter with the monsters.
- Stay aware of your position relative to the trash and monsters to plan your movement and attacks effectively.
- Use the pause feature (`Esc`) if you need a moment to strategize or take a break.

Dive into **Trash Troopers** and test your reflexes and strategy skills. Can you conquer the trash monsters and clean up the environment? Good luck!
