**Trash Troopers** is an immersive, fast-paced video game developed using the powerful `pygame` library in Python. In this game, players embark on an engaging mission to collect trash scattered across the screen while battling formidable trash monsters. Quick reflexes and strategic gameplay are your best allies as you tackle this challenge!

## 🌟 Gameplay Overview
- **Objective**: Collect all the trash that spawns on the screen to increase your score and boost your health.
- **Challenge**: Be on guard! Trash monsters will chase and try to deplete your health. Keep an eye on their movement and avoid direct contact as you race against time.

## 🎮 Controls

  - **WASD**: Move up, left, right, and down.
  - **Arrow Keys**: Alternate movement option.
- **Pause**:
  - **Esc**: Pause the game.
- **Attack**:
  - **Space Bar**: Hold to attack nearby trash monsters. But be careful – when they’re close enough to attack, they’re dangerously close to you!

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics
- **Health Bar**: Increases as you collect trash, but decreases rapidly if a monster makes contact.
- **Trash Spawning**: New trash items appear every 10 seconds. Stay on your toes and be quick to keep up with the pace!
- **Monster Behavior**:
  - Monsters patrol the area and will chase you when you enter their range.
