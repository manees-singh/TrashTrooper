GAME TITLE: TRASH TROOPERS
  This is a video game done in python using pygame.
Your goal is to collect all of the trash on the screen.
Trash will spawn in the middle area of the screen.
CONTROLS:
wasd - up,left,right,down
or
up arrow, left arrow, down arrow, and right arrow.

Also, if the trash monster gets close enough,
hold the space bar to attack the trash monsters.
Careful, though, when you are close enough to attack,
they dangerously close to you already.

As you collect trash, your health bar will go up.
There will be one trash added to the screen every 10 seconds,
so be quick!

However, the trash monsters will quickly lower your
health when they run into you.
When you load the game, you will quickly have to start moving to pickup trash,
as the trash monsters will try to attack you. You will aggrevate the trash monsters to
attack you when you enter their general area. They will de-aggrevate if you move far
enough away.
